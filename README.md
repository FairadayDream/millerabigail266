 
Hello! ðŸ‘‹, I'm Abigail and you have landed on my site. 

Glad we have the chance to meet! 
Now that you are here let me share a little treat.. 
Only **two** of these things are false:  
`
I am a member of the A grade association for academic acheivement. 
I was an orphan. 
I owned 2 businesses prior to software engineering at the age of 19.  
I will *not* help you with your engineering task. 
`
*I'll leave the answer key up to your best guesses.*

Now that you know a bit about me.. 
lets talk about you.. 
what you need, and why you are here.. 
I invite you to email me your requirements..
